# easyEnrich
 easyEnrich is an R package aimed at simplifying pathway and enrichment analysis workflows. It integrates with tools like GO and Enrichr (with plans to support others) and will provide customisable visualisation options such as tables and plots. The package is in early development, and many features are not yet implemented.
